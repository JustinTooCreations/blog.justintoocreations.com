I was in Saratoga this evening at [WestGate Church](http://westgatechurch.org/) preparing for Saturday's [TBC](http://tbc.city/) quarterly Large Gathering event with [Dharius Daniels](http://www.kcnj.org/about/our-pastor/).

Since preparations ended around peak traffic time, I decided to stay in Saratoga to capture a beautiful Autumn sunset while I was in the area. I had no plan of where I would go so I ended up just driving around, frantically looking for a picturesque location to take a photo before the sun would set.

Finally, as I was driving alongside the Saraotga hills, I spotted this railroad track. I made a u-turn and conveniently parked in the business parking lot adjacent to the tracks. I had to get down and dirty for this shot, but it was totally worth it -

It was such a gorgeous sunset with beautiful hues of pink. I enjoyed my time delighting in another wonderful sunset while runners and bikers went to and fro along the adjacent trail - [Joe's Trail at Saratoga de Anza](http://www.saratoga.ca.us/cityhall/pw/projects/joe/).
