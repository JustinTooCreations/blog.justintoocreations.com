There was such a gorgeous sunset this evening in the western horizon from the [Evergreen Hills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreen,_San_Jose,_California) in San Jose. I just had to get back outside when I got home from work to take this romantic picture with my beautiful fianc√©e.

It was already 6:30 PM - about 30 minutes before sunset - when we decided to drive down the road to the nearby [Montgomery Hill Park](https://www.yelp.com/biz/montgomery-hill-park-san-jose). We parked our car in the adjacent [Evergreen Valley College](http://www.evc.edu/) parking lot. Then we grabbed our gear and began the short hike up the steep ascent beside Yerba Buena Road.

With the skyline looking more and more beautiful with the sun quickly setting, we were very motivated to keep one foot in front of the other.

It's not the easiest walk up the hill, but it's well worth the effort. At the top, you are greeted with two wooden benches and this picturesque view -

We sat on the hilltop until the stars began to shine in the night sky. And it was such a beautiful summer evening with warm weather, this gorgeous sunset, and the love of my life. And we were't alone. There was a steady flow of couples, families, and mountain bicyclists throughout the Park, but it never felt crowded and everyone else was very polite and friendly.

Montomgery Hill Park is definitely a great location for beautiful pictures in the beautiful rolling hills of Evergreen in southeast San Jose. I can't wait to come back in the Springtime for a recreation of this photo when the hills are lush and green.
