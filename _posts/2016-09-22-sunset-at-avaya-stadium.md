Tonight's unexpected adventure took my fiancée and I all over Santa Clara in search of a nice location to capture a sunset photo.

We had to pick up my fiancée's sister from the [Mineta San Jose International Airport](http://www.flysanjose.com/fl/) so we were looking for a location nearby.

Surprisingly - or not surprisingly - it wasn't quick and easy to spot a location to capture a sunset landscape just driving around without aim, probably because of the flat terrain of Santa Clara.

We got pretty desperate as the clock ticked ever closer to sunset time. We even drove through part of [Santa Clara University](https://www.scu.edu/).

Finally, we headed back toward the airport and just as I was about to give up hope, I remembered seeing the [Avaya Stadium](http://www.sjearthquakes.com/avayastadium) - the soccer stadium of the [San Jose Earthquakes](http://www.sjearthquakes.com/) - before we took off. So we jammed to the stadium and found it conveniently located right next to the airport runways.

The stadium is pristine and beautiful, especially with the red and pink hues of the setting sun glistening in the blue sky above -

We spent half an hour capturing some creative shots of the stadium before we had to go to the airport - it was so much fun out there in the peaceful weekday night. I can't wait to come back for a game!
