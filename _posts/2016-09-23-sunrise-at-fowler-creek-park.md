My body just woke up at 5:30 AM this morning so I decided to get out of bed to go capture the morning sunrise.

Before heading out, I checked some emails, toasted up a jalapeno cheese bagel, and brewed my morning coffee. Then around 6:30 AM I drove down the street to the nearby [Fowler Creek Park](https://www.yelp.com/biz/fowler-creek-park-san-jose).

Fowler Park is usually quite busy with families and their children. The Park has grand views from the lookout point, which is just a few flights of stairs up from the main playground area. There are also tennis courts, BBQ and picnic areas, a big gazebo (first-come, first-served), and a really nice lawn area to relax on or to play catch.

By the time I arrived at the Park around 6:45 AM, there weren't any signs of people yet, but I could see and hear families waking up in the surrounding homes.

I parked my car on the side street, grabbed my camera bag and tripod, and then proceeded to walk up the stairs to the topmost lookout point. I don't recall ever visiting the Park to watch the sunrise so I didn't know what to expect, other than seeing the sun rising over the mountains - towards the East.

By the time I got to the top of the Park, I could see a beautiful red hue in the clouds as the sun was creeping up behind the distant mountain. I didn't waste any time scouting different spots and angles for the perfect picture I was envisioning to take.

And at 6:59 AM, I had the blessing of capturing this gorgeous Friday sunrise. Happy Friday! And happy 2nd day of Autumn!
